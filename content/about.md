# About

For many years now there has been a general purpose WordPress Meetup in Berlin, which is organized and structured topic-independent. This Meetup has now reached a participant size and diversity that there is a demand for more topic-specific add-ons.

By organizing another Meetup, targeted towards WordPress developers, administrators, dev-ops, et al., we want to strengthen this part of the community and offer interesting and instructive lectures. We're also looking to include those who did not - or not sufficiently - feel addressed by the previous offers to access the local WordPress community.

We invite everyone regardless of age, sex, religion, sexual orientation, cultural background, language to be a part of this meetup. While the contents will get technical, we encourage everyone to participate. 

Please see our [/contributing](/contributing) page to check how to get involved and improve the community work not only for you but everyone.
